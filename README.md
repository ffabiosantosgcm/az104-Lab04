# Lab 04 - Implement Virtual Networking

# Lab scenario

You need to explore Azure virtual networking capabilities. To start, you plan to create a virtual network in 
Azure that will host a couple of Azure virtual machines. Since you intend to implement network-based 
segmentation, you will deploy them into different subnets of the virtual network. You also want to make 
sure that their private and public IP addresses will not change over time. To comply with Contoso security 
requirements, you need to protect public endpoints of Azure virtual machines accessible from Internet. 
Finally, you need to implement DNS name resolution for Azure virtual machines both within the virtual 
network and from Internet.
